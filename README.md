The training outputs have been provided as PDFs inside the `docs/training/` directory.
In particular, the training directories follow the naming convention below:
- **E**: #epochs of training;
- **D**: #dimensions in the latent space;
- **tanh**/**none**: latent activation function used by the encoder for generating means and variances;
- **KL**: regularization coefficient.

More information about the project is provided within the notebook, either inside this
repository or on Colab. Also, a summary of the project is provided in the **PowerPoint
Presentation** inside the `docs` directory ([Download Presentation](https://github.com/jahrim/dl-project/raw/master/docs/landscape-generation.pdf)).
